# UI.Vision

[UI.Vision](https://ui.vision/) is a pretty amazing tool - it's build on Selenium, and it's Selenium's headless browser automation, except not headless!

I use this tool for performing repetitive tasks that, for one reason or another, can't be done through an API or cURL or other scripting solution. Whether it's Blackboard's unreliable DOM (and the fact the college won't supply me with credentials), or Outlook Web's... peculiarities, this is how I avoid endless pointing and clicking and copying and pasting while still being able to supervise the process.

To run any of the scripts in this folder, install the UI.Vision browser extension, and click the button to create a new macro. Then simply click on the "Source View (JSON)" tab and paste in the contents of any of these files.
