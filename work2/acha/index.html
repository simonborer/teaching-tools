An abandoned vehicle can be a nuisance and an eyesore. No matter the reasons a vehicle is left on private property, such things take up space causing countless problems as well as being a blot on the landscape.</p> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hammer">Let's go</a>

		<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevergiveup">Why?</a><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ad/Tubman.jpg" width="150" height="200" alt="Harriet Tubman" class="float-left">One rule in life is to never give up.Harriet Tubman (born Araminta Ross, c. March 1822[1] – March 10, 1913) was an American abolitionist and political activist. Born into slavery, Tubman escaped and subsequently made some 13 missions to rescue approximately 70 enslaved people, including family and friends,[2] using the network of antislavery activists and safe houses known as the Underground Railroad. During the American Civil War, she served as an armed scout and spy for the Union Army. In her later years, Tubman was an activist in the movement for women's suffrage.Born enslaved in Dorchester County, Maryland, Tubman was beaten and whipped by her various masters as a child. Early in life, she suffered a traumatic head wound when an irate overseer threw a heavy metal weight intending to hit another enslaved person, but hit her instead. The injury caused dizziness, pain, and spells of hypersomnia, which occurred throughout her life. After her injury, Tubman began experiencing strange visions and vivid dreams, which she ascribed to premonitions from God. These experiences, combined with her Methodist upbringing, led her to become devoutly religious.</p>
		<p>In 1849, Tubman became ill again, which diminished her value as a slave. Edward Brodess tried to sell her, but could not find a buyer.[36] Angry at him for trying to sell her and for continuing to enslave her relatives, <span class="on-hover"> Tubman began to pray for her owner, asking God to make him change his ways.</span> [37] She said later: "I prayed all night long for my master till the first of March; and all the time he was bringing people to look at me, and trying to sell me." When it appeared as though a sale was being concluded, "I changed my prayer", she said. "First of March I began to pray, 'Oh Lord, if you ain't never going to change that man's heart, kill him, Lord, and take him out of the way.'"[38] A week later, Brodess died, and Tubman expressed regret for her earlier sentiments.[39]</p><a href="#top" class="back-to-top">Back to top</a></section>
